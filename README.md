My Robot Playground

This is a simple Finite State Machine routine I created to freshen up on C++/Boost.

Eventually it will make it into a robot project, but for now, its here and free 
to use as you see fit.

Ideas on where to possibly take this next
-----------------------------------------
* Add generic timer interrupt mechanism.
* Modify to be a hierarchical state machine.
* Add image capture module, OpenCV image object recognition.
* Port to AVR.
* Add in ZeroMQ for communications.



REQUIREMENTS
* Boost Library with logging.
