I think that there will be lots of FSM's and they will be created on the fly eventually, so a database will be a better solution.

TABLE: FSM

FSM_NAME:
FSM_STATE:

Table: STATES
STATE_NAME: varchar
STATE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: seconds
STATE_ON_HEARTBEAT: function
STATE_ON_ENTER: function
STATE_ON_EXIT: function

TABLE: STATE_TRANSITIONS
STATE_NAME: varchar
COMMAND: varchar
NEXT_STATE: varchar
